# Project 3, Portfolio.

Your portfolio is your digital business card and shop window. It's important you make it as compelling as possible. A portfolio of eight to ten interesting pieces of work is ideal. Portfolio pages should exhibit a degree of uniformity and order. Create a grid, and make sure every project adheres to this grid. This may be difficult if you show a variety of projects (2D and 3D) but itâ€™s worth trying to get this right because you will be judged on how your work is presented as much as by the work itself. A portfolio that has an underlying unity and structure will score more points (and be more enjoyable to view) than one that has no structure or cohesion.

Develop your project iteratively. Start by considering your goals and audience. Begin planning, sketching, creating a sitemap and wireframing. You may use anything we've learned in this class: HTML, CSS, javascript, Jquery, P5, frameworks. Include at least 8 works. Consider quality over quantity. There is no max limit of pages for this assignment.
