# Resources
* [CSS Dropdown Menus](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dropdowns.asp) tutorial on W3Schools
* Good tutorial for [Working with grids](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground) to divide up your pages. If you read this, you will understand how to divide up and layout a basic webpage better. And you can use these skills to build a professionally laid-out website for an organization or company. I took the above tutorial and built a basic working example / basic website with a fullscreen view [here](https://codepen.io/2sman/full/LzLNyQ) and an editable-with-code version [here](https://codepen.io/2sman/pen/LzLNyQ).
